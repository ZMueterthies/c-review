# c-review
This repository is a personal refresher project while I work through **_The C Programming Language_ (Kernighan & Ritchie, ANSI C edition)** cover to cover.  

The goal of this repo is to:
- Revisit core concepts and reinforce best practices
- Sharpen low-level programming fundamentals
- Keep my C knowledge active and practical

---

## Contents

- Solutions to K&R exercises (with my own commentary where helpful)
- Small C programs written to test or revisit concepts
